<h2>No presentation needed</h2>
    <p>Pizza is maybe the "internationalistiest" food 
        on the planet. But the real good one is 
        the neapolitan style pizza! (sorry rest of the world)
        A very pleasure to share with friends, watching
        your loved football club or just taking a fast 
        lunch break.

<h2>Ingredients (4 to five pizzas)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams "0" flour</li>
        <li>325 grams of water</li>
        <li>3 grams of beer yeast</li>
        <li>12 grams of salt</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Let's do it!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put all the water in a large
            pot, add the yeast and mix!</li>
        <li>Now add flour and start incorporating
            water inside the dough.</li>
        <li>When you have a good smooth dough, 
            let's cover it with a towel for about 15 minutes.
            Then let's mix again to create gluten matrix and 
            let's rest covered for at least 8hrs (up to 48).</li>
        <li>Two hours before baking, prepare the little
            doughs, divide the big one in 4/5 pieces and
            round-it. Rest till the baking time.</li>
        <li>When it's time to prepare, with open hand
            flatten the dough from the center outside.
            A bit of olive oil and the it's up to you 
            which ingredients want to put on it. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
